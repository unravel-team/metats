# metats
Getting started quickly in Typescript projects, inspired by [unravel/metaclj](https://github.com/unravel-team/metaclj)

## How to use me
Copy the Makefile into your Typescript project

Running the `make` command will show you the following (below). **Follow this list** from top to bottom, for fun and profit.

```
help                      # A brief listing of all available commands
install                   # Install dependencies and create node_modules
install-dev-tools         # Install all development tools (ESLint, Jest, Prettier, Typescript)
upgrade-libs              # Upgrade all dependencies to their latest versions
check                     # Check that the code is well linted, well typed, well documented
format                    # Format code with Prettier and fix ESLint issues
test                      # Run all the tests for the code
test-watch                # Run tests in watch mode
dev                       # Run the Next.js development server with Turbopack
build                     # Build the Next.js application for production
start                     # Start the production server
docker-compose-build      # Build all the local infra (docker-compose)
up                        # Bring up all the local infra (docker-compose)
down                      # Bring down all the local infra (docker-compose)
logs                      # Show all the logs (docker-compose)
deploy                    # Deploy the current code to production
clean-cache               # Clean npm cache and Next.js cache
clean                     # Delete any existing artifacts
```

## Recommended tooling:

### Direnv: For loading and unloading `.env` files correctly.

[direnv](https://direnv.net/) is a fantastic tool for managing environment variables correctly.

The standard configuration for it is available at: [direnv.toml](dev_tools/configuration/direnv.toml). Copy this file to: `~/.config/direnv/direnv.toml`
